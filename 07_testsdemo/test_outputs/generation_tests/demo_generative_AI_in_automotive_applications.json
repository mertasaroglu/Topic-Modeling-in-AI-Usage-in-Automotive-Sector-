Unlike traditional AI models that are typically used\nfor classification, detection, or prediction tasks, generative AI\ncreates novel outputs based on the patterns it has learned\nfrom existing data. In the automotive industry, generative AI\nhas far-reaching implications. For instance, it can be used\nto create realistic simulations of driving environments for\ntesting autonomous vehicles, generate synthetic data to train\nAI models, and even design new vehicle components or\noptimize manufacturing processes. By leveraging generative\nAI, the automotive industry can accelerate the development\nof safer, more efficient, and innovative vehicles, reducing the\ntime and cost associated with traditional design and testing\nmethods.arXiv:2511.00026v1 [cs.RO] 26 Oct 2025\nGenerative AI is powered by several key technologies,\namong which Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and\nVariational Autoencoders (V AEs) are the most prominent.\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Introduced by",
