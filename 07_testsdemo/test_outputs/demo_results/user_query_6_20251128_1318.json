  "question": "Which technologies are likely to mature next year?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, we can assess the maturity of technologies mentioned in the reports. However, please note that the context does not provide explicit information on the current stage of each technology. We will make inferences based on the available data and reports.\n\n**Emerging Technologies 2025 Report**\n\nThe report highlights the top 10 emerging technologies of 2025, which are expected to shape the future of sustainability and create new foundations for trust in connected systems. While the report does not provide explicit information on the current stage of each technology, we can infer that they are likely in the Research Phase (TRL 1-4) or Development Phase (TRL 5-6).\n\nThe report mentions that these technologies have the potential to transform our world, suggesting that they are in the early stages of development. The introduction of ecosystem readiness maps, which provide practical guidance on scaling these technologies, implies that they are ready for further development and deployment.\n\n**Top 10 Emerging Technologies of 2025**\n\n1. **Artificial General Intelligence**: This technology is likely in the Research Phase (TRL 1-4), as it is still an emerging area of research and development.\n2. **Extended Reality**: This technology is likely in the Development Phase (TRL 5-6), as it has been gaining traction in recent years and has several applications in various industries.\n3. **Quantum Computing**: This technology is likely in the Research Phase (TRL 1-4), as it is still in its early stages of development and has significant technical challenges to overcome.\n4. **Synthetic Biology**: This technology is likely in the Development Phase (TRL 5-6), as it has been gaining attention in recent years and has several applications in biotechnology and medicine.\n5. **Autonomous Systems**: This technology is likely in the Development Phase (TRL 5-6), as it has been gaining traction in recent years and has several applications in various industries.\n6. **Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology**: This technology is likely in the Commercialization Phase (TRL 7-9), as it has been widely adopted in various industries and has several applications in finance, supply chain management, and more.\n7. **Advanced Materials**: This technology is likely in the Development Phase (TRL 5-6), as it has been gaining attention in recent years and has several applications in various industries.\n8. **Biotechnology and Gene Editing**: This technology is likely in the Development Phase (TRL 5",
