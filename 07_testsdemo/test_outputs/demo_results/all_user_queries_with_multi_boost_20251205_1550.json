The automotive industry saw explosive growth in the early 20th century thanks to mass production techniques pioneered by companies like Ford, which began with the invention of the internal combustion engine in the late 19th century. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), sensors, and machine learning have made a reality for self-driving. These systems rely on a combination of technologies like LIDAR, radar, cameras, and neural networks to navigate and make real-time decisions. This improves safety and reduces the human error.

    "question": "Which automotive technologies are reaching commercial maturity in the next 12 months?",
    "answer": "**Direct Answer to the Main Question:**\nBased on the provided context, it appears that the automotive technologies reaching commercial maturity in the next 12 months are primarily focused on software and electronics, particularly in the areas of infotainment, connected services, and energy management.\n\n**Supporting Details with Specific Examples:**\n\n1. **Infotainment and Connected Services:**\n\t* Expected to integrate services typical of smartphones, such as virtual assistants, media consumption, and productivity software.\n\t* Already seeing growth in SW development, integration, and validation (Exhibit 5: 9% CAGR 2020-30).\n\t* [Source: Automotive Software 2030 Report]\n2. **Energy Management:**\n\t* Proliferation of EVs will drive further evolution in energy management.\n\t* SW development and testing will be crucial for enabling sophisticated functions and interaction between SW and HW.\n\t* [Source: Automotive Software 2030 Report]\n3. **Autonomous Driving:**\n\t* Vehicles are expected to drive autonomously, which will require advanced SW and electronics.\n\t* This will enable passengers to expect integrated services similar to those on smartphones.\n\t* [Source: Automotive Software 2030 Report]\n\n**Source Citations:**\n\n* [Source: Automotive Software 2030 Report]\n* [Source: McKinsey analysis]\n\n**Summary or Implications:**\nThe automotive industry is expected to see significant growth in software and electronics, driven by the increasing demand for infotainment, connected services, and energy management. As a result, companies need to develop a strategic perspective on SW and electronics, and invest in sustained effort in SW development and testing.",
