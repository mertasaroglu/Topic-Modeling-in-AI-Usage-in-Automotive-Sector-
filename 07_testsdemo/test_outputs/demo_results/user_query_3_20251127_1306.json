  "answer": "Based on the provided context from the McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 and Bcg AI Value 2025 reports, here is a summary of the latest tech trends in the development of AI agents:\n\n1. **Agentic AI capabilities**: AI agents are being developed to independently plan and execute complex, multistep tasks, communicate with each other, and adapt to new information. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n2. **General-purpose agent platforms**: Developers are building AI-powered, general-purpose agent platforms, and some companies are adding agentic capabilities to their existing platforms. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n3. **Specialized agents**: Specialized agents are being designed for deep research, and significant advancements have emerged in this area. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n4. **AI-to-AI communication**: Developments in AI-to-AI communication have implications for robotics, complex problem-solving, and other fields, but also raise concerns about transparency and control. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n5. **Rising concerns about trust, governance, and liability**: As AI agents take on more autonomous roles, businesses are increasingly grappling with accountability and legal frameworks. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n6. **Robust governance frameworks**: There is a critical need for robust governance frameworks to address trust, liability, and ethical concerns related to agentic AI. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n7. **Hybrid worker environments**: Operating in a hybrid worker environment, where humans and AI agents collaborate, calls for new management capabilities and skills evolution. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n8. **Inclusiveness in AI development**: Future-built companies involve the workforce twice as often as others do in reshaping workflows as they build, test, and deploy agents, ensuring smoother adoption and building ownership and trust. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n9. **Responsible AI**: Efforts are underway in the United States to enact legislation that would establish guardrails for AI, reflecting a movement within the tech industry known as \"responsible AI.\" [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\nOverall, the development of AI agents is rapidly advancing, with significant advancements in capabilities, platforms, and specialized agents. However, concerns about trust, governance, and liability are also rising, highlighting the",
