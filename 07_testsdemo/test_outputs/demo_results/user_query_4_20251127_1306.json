  "question": "What are the key patents in automotive AI with US jurisdiction?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, I will attempt to answer the question about key patents in automotive AI with US jurisdiction.\n\nUnfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about specific patents in automotive AI with US jurisdiction. The context includes research papers and a tech report, but none of them mention patents or provide information about patent applications or granted patents.\n\nHowever, I can suggest some possible sources where you may be able to find information about key patents in automotive AI with US jurisdiction:\n\n1. Patent databases: You can search patent databases such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database or the European Patent Office (EPO) database for patents related to automotive AI.\n2. Patent search platforms: Platforms like Google Patents or PatentScope can help you search for patents and filter results by jurisdiction, kind codes, and other criteria.\n3. Industry reports and publications: Reports and publications from industry analysts, research firms, and patent law firms may provide information about key patents in automotive AI with US jurisdiction.\n\nIf you would like to proceed with searching for patents, I can provide some general guidance on how to search for patents and interpret patent documents.\n\nAlternatively, if you would like to explore other topics related to automotive AI, I can attempt to answer questions based on the provided context.",
