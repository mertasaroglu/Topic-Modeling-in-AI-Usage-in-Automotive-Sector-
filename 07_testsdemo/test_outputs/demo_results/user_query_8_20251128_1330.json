  "question": "Which automotive technologies are moving from academy to application?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, we can assess the current stage of automotive technologies that are moving from the academy to application.\n\n**Technology Maturity Assessment:**\n\n1. **GPS Technology:** The context mentions Motsee, a startup that aims to build a GPS-based open platform for moving services and people. This suggests that GPS technology has reached the **Commercialization Phase (TRL 7-9)**, as it is being used to develop a commercial product. [Source: startups_data]\n\n2. **Automotive Software and Electronics:** The Automotive Software and Electronics 2030 Report highlights the trend of technology borders between the automotive and consumer electronics worlds being torn down. This indicates that automotive software and electronics are in the **Development Phase (TRL 5-6)**, as companies are assessing their capabilities and becoming part of early discussions to navigate the changing landscape. [Source: Automotive Software and Electronics 2030 Report]\n\n3. **Braille-Based Technology:** The context mentions Skyriz, a startup that aims to develop a Braille-based smartphone. This suggests that Braille-based technology has reached the **Development Phase (TRL 5-6)**, as it is being used to develop a prototype. [Source: startups_data]\n\n**Transition Indicators and Timelines:**\n\n* The Automotive Software and Electronics 2030 Report suggests that the trend of technology borders being torn down will continue, indicating a long-term transition.\n* The context mentions startups like Motsee and Skyriz, which are developing commercial products and prototypes, respectively. This suggests that the transition from the academy to application is ongoing and will continue in the near term.\n\n**Additional Insights:**\n\n* The context highlights the importance of technology architecture capabilities and early discussions in navigating the changing landscape of automotive software and electronics. This suggests that companies need to assess their capabilities and become part of early discussions to successfully navigate the changing landscape.\n* The trend of technology borders being torn down between the automotive and consumer electronics worlds presents opportunities and risks for companies in the automotive industry. This suggests that companies need to be prepared to adapt to changing technologies and trends.\n\n**Acknowledgment:**\n\n* The context does not provide sufficient information to assess the current stage of technologies like Homeshift, Commonplace, moveBuddha, and MANTIS Ad Network.",
