  "question": "Which technologies are likely to mature next year?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, we can assess the maturity of emerging technologies and identify potential transition indicators and timelines.\n\n**Assessment of Current Stage:**\n\nFrom the World Economic Forum's Emerging Technologies 2025 report, we can see that the selected technologies are in various stages of development. However, the report does not provide explicit information on the current stage of each technology. Nevertheless, we can make some inferences based on the context:\n\n1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The report mentions AI as an overarching category, which suggests that AI has reached a certain level of maturity. However, the specific subcategories (applied AI, generative AI, industrializing machine learning, and next-generation software development) indicate that AI is still in the development phase (TRL 5-6).\n2. **Agentic AI**: This technology is new to the report, indicating that it is still in the research phase (TRL 1-4).\n3. **Application-specific semiconductors**: The report does not provide explicit information on the current stage of this technology. However, the fact that it is mentioned as a new trend suggests that it is still in the research phase (TRL 1-4).\n4. **Future of energy and sustainability technologies**: This trend combines electrification and renewables, which suggests that it is in the development phase (TRL 5-6).\n5. **Space technologies**: The report mentions equity investment insights into the future of space technologies, indicating that space technologies are still in the research phase (TRL 1-4).\n\n**Transition Indicators and Timelines:**\n\nBased on the provided context, we can identify some transition indicators and timelines:\n\n1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The report mentions that AI has reached a certain level of maturity, but the specific subcategories indicate that AI is still in the development phase. This suggests that AI will continue to mature in the next year, with potential commercialization (TRL 7-9) in the near future.\n2. **Agentic AI**: The fact that agentic AI is new to the report suggests that it will take some time to mature. However, the report does not provide explicit information on the timeline for agentic AI.\n3. **Application-specific semiconductors**: The report does not provide explicit information on the timeline for application-specific semiconductors.\n4. **Future of energy and sustainability technologies**: The fact that this trend combines electrification and renewables suggests that",
