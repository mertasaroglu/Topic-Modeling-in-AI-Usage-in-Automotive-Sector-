However, specific technologies and their maturity levels are not explicitly mentioned.\n\n**Supporting Details with Specific Examples:**\n\n1. **Infotainment and Connected Services:**\n\t* The report mentions that once vehicles are able to drive autonomously, passengers will expect the infotainment system to integrate services typical of smartphones, such as virtual assistants, media consumption, and productivity software.\n\t* This implies that infotainment systems with advanced features are nearing commercial maturity.\n2. **Energy Management:**\n\t* The report highlights energy management as a prime target for further evolution with the proliferation of Electric Vehicles (EVs).\n\t* This suggests that energy management technologies, particularly those related to EVs, are reaching commercial maturity.\n3. **SW and E/E Market Growth:**\n\t* The report states that the SW and E/E market is expected to vastly outpace growth in the overall automotive market, with a 3 percent CAGR in the same time span.\n\t* This indicates that the market for software and electronics in the automotive industry is rapidly growing and reaching commercial maturity.\n\n**Source Citations:**\n\n* [Source: Automotive Software 2030 Report]\n* [Source: McKinsey analysis]\n\n**Summary and Implications:**\n\nThe provided context suggests that the automotive industry is undergoing significant changes driven by sustainable technological innovation. The commercial maturity of software and electronics technologies, particularly in infotainment, connected services, and energy management, is expected to have a profound impact on the industry's value chains and long-established business models. As these technologies reach commercial maturity, automotive companies and their executives must adapt and develop strategic perspectives on software and electronics to remain competitive.",
