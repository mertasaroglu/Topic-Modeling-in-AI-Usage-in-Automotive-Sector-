  "question": "Which startups work on AI for automotive?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, I will attempt to answer the question \"Which startups work on AI for automotive?\" However, I must acknowledge that the context does not explicitly mention specific startups working on AI for automotive. \n\nGiven the research papers and reports provided, it appears that they focus on the applications, benefits, and challenges of generative AI in the automotive industry, as well as the development of synthetic dialog datasets for driver-AI interactions. There is no mention of specific startups working on AI for automotive.\n\nHowever, I can provide some general insights based on the provided reports:\n\n* The McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 report mentions the development of AI agents that can \"talk\" to each other and create their own languages, which could potentially be applied to the automotive industry. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n* The BCG AI Value 2025 report provides a framework for organizations to adopt and scale AI, which could be applied to the automotive industry. However, it does not mention specific startups working on AI for automotive. [Source: Bcg AI Value 2025]\n\nUnfortunately, without more specific information or context, I am unable to provide a comprehensive list of startups working on AI for automotive.",
