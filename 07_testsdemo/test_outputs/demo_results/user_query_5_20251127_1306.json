  "question": "Show me recent reports on technology trends.",
  "answer": "Based on the provided context, here are recent reports on technology trends:\n\n1. **Equity Investment in Technology Trends**: According to the McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025, equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased in 2024 despite the broader market dip in 2023. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n2. **Talent Demand and Equity Investment**: The McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 also reports that the talent demand ratio for skilled people to job vacancies is relatively low, indicating a potential shortage of skilled workers in the technology sector. Additionally, equity investment in private- and public-market capital raises for relevant technologies has increased. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n3. **Emerging Trends**: The report highlights emerging trends such as agentic AI, application-specific semiconductors, and the future of energy and sustainability technologies. These trends are expected to drive innovation and address critical challenges across sectors. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n4. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI stands out as a powerful technology wave that is driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, accelerating progress within individual domains and unlocking new possibilities at the intersections. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\n5. **5G Networks**: 5G networks are transforming space communication by integrating with satellite systems, extending high-speed, low-latency internet coverage to remote areas, and improving global telecommunications. [Source: McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025]\n\nRegarding patent documents, the provided context does not include any specific patent information. However, based on the guidelines provided, if a patent question were to be asked, it would be essential to consider the jurisdiction (geographic protection scope) and kind codes (document type and status) to assess the market focus and protection scope.\n\nFor trend questions, the provided context identifies velocity, drivers, and key players for emerging trends such as agentic AI, application-specific semiconductors, and the future of energy and sustainability technologies.\n\nFor forecasting, the McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook 2025 report provides insights into the near-term and long-term developments in technology trends, including the expected growth of equity investment and talent demand.\n\nFor descriptive questions, the provided context includes specific examples and entities, such as the Boiler Room, Articheck, and",
