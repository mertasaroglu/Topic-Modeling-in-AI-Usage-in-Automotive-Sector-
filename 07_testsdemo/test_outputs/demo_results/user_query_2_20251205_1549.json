  "question": "Show me recent patents on AI for automotive vehicles.",
  "answer": "**Recent Patents on AI for Automotive Vehicles**\n\nBased on the provided context, there are no recent patents on AI for automotive vehicles mentioned. However, I can guide you through the process of extracting patent details and analyzing jurisdictions.\n\n**PATENT QUERY GUIDANCE:**\n\n1. **EXTRACT PATENT DETAILS**: Unfortunately, no patent details are provided in the context. However, I can provide a general outline of how to extract patent details:\n\n* Patent numbers (e.g., **US1234567**, **EP1234567**, **WO1234567**)\n* Titles (e.g., \"AI-Powered Vehicle Navigation System\")\n* Inventors (e.g., \"John Doe, Jane Smith\")\n* Assignees (e.g., \"General Motors, LLC\")\n* Jurisdictions (e.g., \"European Patent Office\", \"United States Patent and Trademark Office\")\n\n2. **ANALYZE JURISDICTIONS**:\n   - **EP**: European Patent Office (covers multiple countries)\n   - **US**: United States Patent and Trademark Office\n   - **WO**: World Intellectual Property Organization (international applications)\n\n3. **IDENTIFY TECHNOLOGIES**: Specific automotive/AI technologies protected (e.g., computer vision, natural language processing, machine learning)\n\n4. **NOTE KEY DATES**: Filing dates, publication dates, grant dates when available\n\n5. **ORGANIZE BY TYPE**: Group by jurisdiction or technology area\n\n6. **SOURCE SPECIFICALLY**: Always cite patent database sources [Source: Automotive Technology Patents Database]\n\n**PATENT DATABASE SOURCES:**\n\nUnfortunately, no patent database sources are provided in the context. However, I can suggest some popular patent databases:\n\n* [Source: Google Patents]\n* [Source: PatentScope]\n* [Source: Espacenet]\n\n**IMPLICATIONS:**\n\nThe lack of patent details and database sources in the context limits the analysis. However, I can provide some general information on recent trends in AI for automotive vehicles.\n\n**RECENT TRENDS:**\n\n* AI-powered vehicle navigation systems\n* Computer vision-based driver assistance systems\n* Natural language processing-based voice assistants\n* Machine learning-based predictive maintenance systems\n\n**SUMMARY:**\n\nUnfortunately, no recent patents on AI for automotive vehicles are mentioned in the provided context. However, I can guide you through the process of extracting patent details and analyzing jurisdictions.",
