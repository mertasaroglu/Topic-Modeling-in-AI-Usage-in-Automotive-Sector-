# Persona narrative

Consulting R&D teams rely heavily on manual work to track trends, technologies, and startups and link them to client needs. AI tools can reduce research time by ~30%, but only ~10% deliver real business value (BCG, 2025).

We built an Innovation Intelligence Suite (B2B2C) MVP that combines intelligent RAG with tech maturity prediction to help R&D teams identify what's next in automotive AI - faster and with greater 
precision. Therefore, our set of user queries are defined by the following target persona:

- Innovation Strategy Consultant (Automotive)
- Works with emerging tech, startups, patents, and research to advise automotive clients
- Needs faster, automated intelligence to turn complex signals into actionable recommendations


# User queries

Q2. “Show me recent patents on AI for automotive vehicles.” (Factual extraction / Sourcing)

Q3. "Which startups work on automotive and autonomous driving?” (Sourcing / Analytical) - take out of scope?

Q4. "What are the key challenges and pain points in automotive AI adoption?" (Descriptive / Explanatory)
