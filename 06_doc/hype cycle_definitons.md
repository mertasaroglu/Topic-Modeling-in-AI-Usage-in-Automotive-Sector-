# Hype Cycle Framework for Technology Maturity Analysis

Core Concept

The Gartner Hype Cycle tracks emerging technologies through five distinct phases of market expectations, providing a framework to understand when technologies transition from academic research to industrial application.

Five Phase Labels & Definitions

📈 1. Innovation Trigger

Market Perception: Initial discovery, breakthrough, or product launch
Academic Activity: Peak research papers, proof-of-concepts
Industry Activity: Patent filings begin, corporate R&D scouting
Key Indicators:

First research publications on the technology
Initial patent applications
Media mentions in technical/specialist press
University research grants awarded

🚀 2. Peak of Inflated Expectations

Market Perception: Over-enthusiasm, unrealistic expectations
Academic Activity: Multiple research groups, conference spotlight
Industry Activity: Startup formation, seed funding, corporate partnerships
Key Indicators:

Exponential growth in media coverage
Venture capital investment spikes
University spin-off formations
Industry conference tracks dedicated to technology
Corporate partnership announcements with academia

🛑 3. Trough of Disillusionment

Market Perception: Failed implementations, waning interest
Academic Activity: Methodological refinement, negative results published
Industry Activity: Failed prototypes, funding pullbacks, pivot strategies
Key Indicators:

Negative or critical media coverage increases
Startup failure rates rise
Funding rounds become smaller/less frequent
Implementation challenges documented
Standards development begins (addressing failures)

📚 4. Slope of Enlightenment

Market Perception: Practical benefits understood, second-generation products
Academic Activity: Applied research, use-case validation
Industry Activity: Pilot projects, ROI calculations, standards development
Key Indicators:

Case studies of successful implementations
Industry consortium formations
Regulatory framework development
Second/third generation product releases
Integration with existing systems documented

🏭 5. Plateau of Productivity

Market Perception: Mainstream adoption, stable growth
Academic Activity: Knowledge transfer, course integration
Industry Activity: Production systems, vendor ecosystems, regulatory compliance
Key Indicators:

Widespread industry adoption (>30% target market)
Price competition begins
Specialized consulting/services market emerges
Integration into industry standards
Academic courses on the technology

# Connecting to Existing Labels (Mert's Data)

Mapping Strategy:

"Early Research" = Innovation Trigger
"Emerging Technology" = Peak of Inflated Expectations
"Developing Technology" = Trough of Disillusionment
"Maturing Technology" = Slope of Enlightenment
"Mature Technology" = Plateau of Productivity
"Legacy Technology" = Post-plateau/Decline phase
