The memory mapping and allocation scheme trades off random and full access in favor of high parallelism and static mapping to a subset of the overall address space. The NN processor is constructed from self-contained computational units organized in a hierarchical architecture. The homogeneity enables simpler management and control of similar computational units, aggregated in multiple levels of hierarchy. Computational units are designed with minimal overhead as possible, where additional features and capabilities are aggregated at higher levels in the hierarchy. On-chip memory provides storage for content inherently required for basic operation at a particular hierarchy and is coupled with the computational resources in an optimal ratio. Lean control provides just enough signaling to manage only the operations required at a particular hierarchical level.

In examples where the camera is fixed and the pose of an object is to be calculated, the trained machine learning system associates image elements from an image of the object with points in an object coordinate frame. In examples, the image elements may be noisy and incomplete and a pose inference engine calculates an accurate estimate of the pose.', 'language': 'en', 'truncated': False}] Camera/object pose from predicted coordinates",2023,7,patent,G06V20/20,

"Systems, methods, and media for artificial intelligence process control in additive manufacturing","Systems, methods, and media for additive manufacturing are provided. In some embodiments, an additive manufacturing system comprises: a hardware processor that is configured to: receive a captured image; apply a trained failure classifier to a low-resolution version of the captured image; determine that a non-recoverable failure is not present in the printed layer of the object; generate a cropped version of the low-resolution version of the captured image; apply a trained binary error classifier to the cropped version of the low-resolution version of the captured image; determine that an error is present in the printed layer of the object; apply a trained extrusion classifier to the captured image, wherein the trained extrusion classifier generates an extrusion quality score; and adjust a value of a parameter of the print head based on the extrusion quality score to print a subsequent layer of the printed object.","Systems, methods, and media for additive manufacturing are provided.
