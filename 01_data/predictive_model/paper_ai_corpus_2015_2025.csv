DeepGS: Predicting phenotypes from genotypes using Deep Learning,"Abstract Motivation Genomic selection (GS) is a new breeding strategy by which the phenotypes of quantitative traits are usually predicted based on genome-wide markers genotypes using conventional statistical models. However, GS prediction models typically make strong assumptions and perform linear regression analysis, limiting their accuracies since they do not capture complex, non-linear relationships within genotypes, between phenotypes. Results We present deep learning method, named DeepGS, to predict from genotypes. Using convolutional neural network, DeepGS uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genotypic when making predictions; it also employs convolution, sampling dropout strategies reduce complexity high-dimensional marker data. used large dataset train compare its performance with other methods.

Structural Affect: An Operational Specification of Internal Affective State in Large Language Models (Structural Qualia v2.2),"Description (EN) This repository contains the specification, LaTeX source, and a lightweight validation kit for Structural Affect / Qualia v2.2 (SQv2.2), structural operational framework quantifying internal affective state of large language models (LLMs). SQv2.2 represents an LLM as six-dimensional vector—pain, joy, anxiety, calm, attachment, conflict—derived from observable statistics such per-token loss entropy, gradient norms, free-energy decrease, epistemic/aleatoric uncertainty, Fisher information, representational similarity, multi-objective alignment. To ensure comparability across inference settings, specification enforces per-token, temperature-corrected measurements at \(T=1\) (NLL\(_1\), H\(_1\)) assumes length-normalized statistics.

While this decline in could be seen as constituting mere biological constraint, we ask whether it might, fact, serve an adaptive function. A natural consequence time‐limited preservation sensory processing mechanisms formed early life. Emerging evidence has supported “adaptive initial degradation” hypothesis, which posits experience with degraded inputs, such blurred color‐reduced vision, helps instantiate important subserving robust perception later Here, employ deep neural networks computational models systematically probe how developmental improvements visual fidelity interact diminishing plasticity, modeled via decreasing learning rates. Across both acuity and color domains, find yields modest performance gains stabilize early‐formed representations. However, these remain surprisingly modest. Further analysis networks’ internal representations also reveals earlier layers sooner than deeper layers, loosely paralleling findings from development. Overall, our results suggest while declining can confer small benefits, not primary force behind more pronounced advantages commencing inputs. These insights refine hypothesis and, broadly, underscore modeling shed light on longstanding questions neuroscience.

While this decline in could be seen as constituting mere biological constraint, we ask whether it might, fact, serve an adaptive function. A natural consequence time‐limited preservation sensory processing mechanisms formed early life. Emerging evidence has supported “adaptive initial degradation” hypothesis, which posits experience with degraded inputs, such blurred color‐reduced vision, helps instantiate important subserving robust perception later Here, employ deep neural networks computational models systematically probe how developmental improvements visual fidelity interact diminishing plasticity, modeled via decreasing learning rates. Across both acuity and color domains, find yields modest performance gains stabilize early‐formed representations. However, these remain surprisingly modest. Further analysis networks’ internal representations also reveals earlier layers sooner than deeper layers, loosely paralleling findings from development. Overall, our results suggest while declining can confer small benefits, not primary force behind more pronounced advantages commencing inputs. These insights refine hypothesis and, broadly, underscore modeling shed light on longstanding questions neuroscience.

This paper introduces Theoretical Optimization Perception and Abstract Synthesis (TOPAS), convergent neuro-symbolic architecture that achieves an Exact Match (EM) score exceeding 69% ARC-II evaluation set. TOPAS rejects tabula rasa assumption pure deep learning, instead proposing ""Canonical Unified Model"" grounded Free Energy Principle (FEP) Integrated Information Theory (IIT). features three novel subsystems: * Hebbian Triad: A separation concerns into (ObjectSlots), Reasoning (NeuroPlanner), Memory (VSA World Models), bound type-safe ""Sacred Signature"" interface. Hypothesis Market: An internal economic system based Hanson’s Logarithmic Market Scoring Rules (LMSR) arbitrates between neural intuition symbolic logic. Thermodynamic Refinement: Energy-Based Refiner (EBR) treats solution generation as thermodynamic settling process, minimizing global free energy functional to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, leverages Muon optimizer geometric regularization sparse networks Test-Time Training (TTT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) generalize out-of-distribution tasks.

Accelerated Bayesian Calibration and Uncertainty Quantification of RANS Turbulence Model Parameters for Stratified Atmospheric Boundary Layer Flows,"Abstract In operational weather models, the effects of turbulence in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on resolved flow are modeled using parameterizations. These parameterizations typically use a predetermined set model parameters that tuned to limited data from canonical flows. Using these fixed results deterministic predictions neglect uncertainty unresolved processes. this study, we perform machine learning-accelerated Bayesian inversion single-column ABL. This approach is used calibrate and quantify Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes models. To verify data-driven quantification methodology, test an idealized setup which prescribed but unobserved learned noisy approximations output. Following verification, learn their uncertainties two different models conditioned scale-resolving large-eddy simulation over range ABL stabilities. We show how numerical improves by investigating underlying mean momentum budgets. Further, based neutral surface recovers relationships between have been predicted theoretical modeling, learning stable or outside can lead parameter than theory. Efforts systematically reduce reveal (1) sampling wind speed up height key $$84\%$$ , (2) assimilating fluid quantities beyond first-order moment statistics further ways baseline assimilation alone cannot achieve. The generally yield lower error standard out-of-sample tests also provide intervals predictions.","Abstract In operational weather models, the effects of turbulence in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) on resolved flow are modeled using parameterizations.
