We introduce the concept of “Design Agents” for engineer-
ing applications, particularly focusing on the automotive design
process, while emphasizing that our approach can be readily ex-
tended to other engineering and design domains. Our framework
integrates AI-driven design agents into the traditional engineer-
ingworkflow,demonstratinghowthesespecializedcomputational
agents interact seamlessly with engineers and designers to aug-
ment creativity, enhance efficiency, and significantly accelerate
the overall design cycle. By automating and streamlining tasks
traditionally performed manually, such as conceptual sketching,
styling enhancements, 3D shape retrieval and generative mod-
eling, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) meshing, and aero-
dynamic simulations, our approach reduces certain aspects of
the conventional workflow from weeks and days down to min-
utes. Theseagentsleveragestate-of-the-artvision-languagemod-

namic simulations to ensure practical and applicable outcomes.
Furthermore, we present design agents that can swiftly and ac-
curatelypredictsimulationoutcomes,empoweringengineersand

1. INTRODUCTION
The design of a car is a multidisciplinary endeavor that bal-
ances engineering performance with aesthetic appeal. Unlike
aircraft design, wherefunctional performance and safetytake ab-
solute priority, automotive design is deeply influenced by styling
and brand identity, making it both an engineering and artistic
process [1–9]. Consumers are drawn to cars not only for their
technicalspecificationsbutalsofortheirvisualappeal,asaesthet-
ics play a crucial role in market success [10]. Consequently, car
designinvolvesacomplexinterplaybetweenaerodynamics,man-
ufacturability,andsubjectiveuserpreferences. Traditionaldesign
workflows rely on iterative refinements where designers sketch
conceptual ideas, evaluate existing designs for inspiration, and
collaborate with engineers to assess performance and feasibility.
While traditional car design workflows often involve a slow
and iterative process of sketching, evaluation, and engineering
refinement, we propose a novel approach that integrates AI De-
sign Agents into the conceptual design phase. In this context,
agents are specialized, autonomous computational systems de-
signed to perform specific design tasks by leveraging artificial
intelligence, machine learning, and automation. These agents
automate critical tasks, streamlining the transition from initial
sketches to fully simulated aerodynamic evaluations. The multi-
agent framework introduced in this work covers key stages of
the car design pipeline, beginning with early-stage sketching and
styling, incorporating large language models (LLMs) and vision-
language models (VLMs) such as Stable Diffusion XL [11] and
ControlNet [12] to enhance and refine conceptual designs. The
process continues with automated 3D shape retrieval and genera-
tion,wheregeometricdeeplearningmodelstransformhand-drawn

agents orchestration.

accelerating and enhancing these traditional workflows. This in-
tegration enables seamless interaction with engineering software
such as Blender [18], OpenFOAM [15], and ParaView [19]. The
system consists of four specialized design agents:
•StylingAgent ,responsibleforgeneratinghigh-resolutionren-
derings and enhancing aesthetic appeal;
•CAD Agent , which facilitates design retrieval from the Dri-
vAerNet++ dataset and enables generative 3D shape model-
ing based on industry-standard designs;
•MeshingAgent ,whichinteractswithOpenFOAMtogenerate
high-quality CFD meshes for aerodynamic simulations; and
•Simulation Agent , which leverages surrogate models to pro-
videreal-timeaerodynamicpredictionswhilealsoretrieving
simulation results from the database.

process,bridgingthegapbetweenconceptualization,performance

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into automo-

innovative solutions for enhancing creativity, performance eval-

a human-centered generative design framework, integrating hu-
manfactorsandmechanicalattributesearlyinthedesignprocess.
Initial case studies suggested that this multidisciplinary approach
yieldedmorediverseandcreativeoutcomes,demonstratingthepo-
tential advantages of synthesizing human-centric considerations
within generative design workflows. Similarly, Yuan et al. [21]
explored AI-driven generative methods for vehicle front-face de-
sign, integrating tools such as ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Vega
AI. Their methodology emphasized a smooth transition through
design phases by systematically blending aesthetic and engineer-
ing criteria. Additionally, they applied Kansei engineering and
AI-driven form generation to tailor designs specifically to female
aesthetics, effectively quantifying subjective preferences and en-
hancingtheworkflowwithtargetedsolutionsalignedwithmarketdemographics.

Similarly, Aréchiga et al. [23] proposed drag-guided diffusion

Further enriching design capabilities, Edwards et al. [25]
presented Sketch2Prototype, a generative AI-based framework
that enabled rapid exploration and prototyping in early design
phases. This approach highlighted the potential of generative
models, specifically in streamlining the iterative process between
conceptcreationanddetailedevaluation. InRef.[26],theauthors
introduced a multi-agent system (MAS) that leveraged vision-
language models (VLMs) and specialized agents mimicking dis-
tinct engineering roles to collaboratively generate CAD models.
Their approach outperformed a single-shot generative baseline,
demonstrating enhanced readiness and requirement compliance
due to its iterative self-feedback architecture.
However,existingstudiesprimarilyfacelimitationsduetothe
lack of large-scale, multimodal datasets that combine diverse de-
sign variations with high-fidelity simulations. This research gap
has constrained the effective coupling of aesthetics and design
performance evaluation, limiting the ability to optimize designs
holistically. Our work addresses this challenge through the Dri-

integrating automation, collaboration, and intelligent decision-
making, these agents enable rapid design iteration. Traditional
car design workflows, from conceptual sketching to simulation,
can take several weeks, whereas our multi-agent framework re-
duces this timeline to minutes by automating 3D shape retrieval,
CFD meshing, and aerodynamic evaluation. The Design Agents

and streamline the entire automotive design process. By seam-
lessly integrating large language models (LLMs), vision-based
latent models such as Stable Diffusion XL [11] with Control-
Net [12], and geometric deep learning models (DeepSDF [27],
PointNet [28], RegDGCNN [13, 14, 29], and TripNet [30]) us-

modalities—including 3D CAD models, 3D meshes, point clouds, voxel grids, depth maps, and part annotations—are leveraged by various generative
AI models depending on the design task, such as retrieval, 3D reconstruction, styling, and aerodynamic simulation. In this work, we further extend

Our multi-agent system facilitates collaboration between en-

Simulation Agent predicts aerodynamic properties in real time

evaluation and optimization.
To orchestrate and coordinate interactions among our pro-
posed AI Design Agents, we leverage AutoGen [17], a frame-
work designed for efficient multi-agent collaboration. Within
this approach, we specifically examine two essential con-
cepts—Sequential vs. Hierarchical vs. Hybrid Agents andCross-
Modal Retrieval —as they critically influence the effectiveness of
our agent-based automotive design workflow.
AutoGen: A Framework for Building AI Agents and Appli-
cations In our work, we leverage AutoGen [17], a framework
developed by Microsoft for creating multi-agent AI applications
that can act autonomously or work alongside humans. It allows
agents to effectively exchange information through natural lan-
guage prompts, enabling the automation of complex workflows
involving diverse software platforms. In our study, Autogen co-
ordinates interactions between specialized design agents, such as
CAD retrieval, mesh generation, aerodynamic simulation, and
styling agents, streamlining the engineering design process and
enhancing productivity and creativity. The integration provided
by AutoGen significantly accelerates tasks by reducing manual
intervention, facilitating rapid design iterations, and improving
collaborative decision-making.Sequential vs. Hierarchical vs. Hybrid Agents Sequential,
hierarchical, and hybrid agents represent different structures for

Cross-Modal Retrieval Cross-modal retrieval in DrivAer-

input modalities. By leveraging deep learning-based retrieval
models, a simple 2D hand-drawn sketch of a car can be used to
retrieve the most aerodynamically similar 3D designs from the
dataset,alongwiththeircorrespondinghigh-fidelityCFDsimula-
tions. Thisallowsdesignerstoexploreoptimizedshapesthatbal-

search for design variations with similar aerodynamic properties.
Theintegrationofimage-andtext-basedquerieswithengineering
data enhances the design workflow, bridging conceptual sketches
with performance-driven design evaluation. Figure 5 illustrates
the diverse data modalities in DrivAerNet++, including 3D CAD
models, meshes, point clouds, voxel grids, depth maps, and part
annotations, while also highlighting our extensions with Signed
DistanceFunction(SDF)representations,multi-viewimages,and
sketches to enhance generative design tasks.
3.1 Enhancing Aesthetic Exploration with the Styling
Agent
Inthissection,weintroducethe StylingAgent todemonstrate
an agentic way of providing design inspirations in automotive
design workflows. Given a hand-drawn sketch accompanied by
a text prompt, our Styling Agent leverages advanced generative
AI models to produce high-resolution, photorealistic renderings
ofcardesigns. Thisenablesdesignerstorapidlyvisualizediverse
aesthetic concepts that are inspired by their sketches and iterate
creatively in early design phases.
To demonstrate our Styling Agent, we required a dataset of
car sketches. As no public dataset exists, we created our own
datasetbasedontheDrivAerNet++dataset. Curatingadatasetof

upon diffusion-based generative models. It incorporates external

tations, or user-generated sketches—to precisely control the gen-
erative process. By embedding these explicit control signals into
diffusion models, ControlNet enables designers to transform pre-

High-resolutionandPhotorealisticRenderingsofCarDesigns
This subsection introduces the process of using vision-language
models, such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) [11] and Con-
trolNet [12], to produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse
car renderings conditioned on user sketches and text prompts.
After generating the sketches using either Canny edge detec-
tion [32] and CLIPasso [33] for abstraction-based sketch gen-
eration, these sketches serve as conditioning inputs for a Con-
trolNet model [12], which refines text-driven generation using
Stable Diffusion v1.5 [11, 36]. We use a combination of base
car design prompts, color variations, and stylistic attributes to
introduce diverse and creative designs. The generated images
are then post-processed to remove the background using mor-
phological operations and contour-based segmentation. The final
outputs, along with metadata including the applied prompts, are
stored for further analysis. This approach can allow designers
toexploremultipleaestheticvariationswhilemaintainingtheun-

the various styling and color variations applied to generate a di-

incorporating different stylistic influences and color schemes to
enhance visual diversity. This approach allows for a broad explo-
ration of aesthetic variations, ensuring that the generated dataset
captures a wide spectrum of design possibilities across multiple
car categories.

3.2.1 Deep Implicit Representations for Automotive
Shapes. Below we outline our approach using DeepSDF to
encode automotive shapes into continuous implicit representa-
tions, enabling efficient shape retrieval and generative modeling.
DeepSDF [27] is a neural implicit representation technique that
encodes 3D shapes into a continuous Signed Distance Function
(SDF) space, allowing for efficient shape reconstruction and in-
terpolation. Our approach extends DeepSDF for car design by
encoding car meshes into a latent space representation while in-

car mesh to fit within a unit sphere and sample 500,000 spatial
points, with a higher concentration near the surface. Each point
(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)isassociatedwithanSDFvaluethatrepresentsthesigned

DeepSDF uses an auto-decoder framework, where a latent
vector z∈R𝑑is learned for each training shape. The network
consists of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with eight fully con-
nected layers of 512 neurons each, utilizing ReLU activations.
Given an input coordinate x∈R3and the latent vector represen-
tation z∈R𝑑, the model predicts the corresponding SDF value
𝑓(x,z).
To improve training efficiency, accuracy, and performance
specific to car designs, we introduce the following modifications:

Here we demonstrate how the CAD Agent retrieves the most

is trained to minimize the L2 loss between the predicted latent
code and the ground truth latent code. We use a single CNN
model for all car classes. During retrieval, the input consists of
a car class and a sketch, and the output is the car mesh with the
closest matching latent code, determined by minimizing the L2

3.3 Automating Computational Meshing with the
Meshing Agent
In this section, we introduce the Meshing Agent , responsible
forgeneratinghigh-qualitycomputationalmeshesfrom3Dcarde-
signs to enable accurate CFD simulations. Given a 3D car model
and text prompts specifying meshing requirements, the Meshing
Agent interacts with OpenFOAM’s snappyHexMesh utility, au-
tomatically producing refined computational meshes. The agent
further verifies mesh quality through standard checks and itera-
tively improves mesh fidelity, ensuring optimal performance for
subsequent aerodynamic analyses.
Recent advancements in leveraging LLMs have demon-
strated promising results in automating and enhancing CFD sim-
ulations. For instance, Pandey et al. [41] introduced Open-
FOAMGPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent tai-
lored for OpenFOAM-based CFD tasks, showcasing its ability to
handle complex simulations efficiently. Similarly, Xu et al. [42]

Mesh generation typically constitutes the most time-consuming

Additionally, SnappyHexMesh is employed for generating high-

3.4.1 Sketch-Based Rapid Retrieval of Aerodynamic
Simulation Results. The Simulation Agent facilitates real-
time retrieval of aerodynamic performance data based on 2D
hand-drawn sketches or design inputs. Given a sketch or con-
ceptual design, it queries the DrivAerNet++ database containing
8,000 high-fidelity CFD simulations in real-time to rapidly iden-
tify and retrieve aerodynamic properties such as drag coefficient,
pressure distribution, and velocity fields.
We use the same approach employed for the Styling Agent,
utilizing a pre-trained CNN, specifically ResNet50 [40], to eval-
uate design diversity. Given a set of 𝑁images, each image 𝑖is
represented by a feature vector f𝑖∈R𝑑. We then calculate the
diversity score by computing the average pairwise L2 distancebetween these feature vectors. Images exhibiting higher average
distances are considered more diverse, reflecting greater visual
or stylistic variance within the dataset. As shown in Figure 11,
the retrieval system identifies similar designs and provides direct
aerodynamic comparisons. Engineers can quantify the improve-
ments in aerodynamic drag and analyze the wake flow, gaining
insights into flow separation and turbulence characteristics. This
processbridgesthegapbetweenearly-stageconceptualdesignand
performance-driven engineering, enabling data-driven decisions
for optimizing aerodynamics while maintaining stylistic intent.
Since DrivAerNet++ includes multiple modalities for each
design, such as parametric data, point clouds, and part annota-
tions, this additional information can be leveraged for various
downstream tasks. For instance, parametric data can be utilized
for manufacturing processes and constraints, while point cloud
representations enable advanced shape analysis and reverse en-
gineering. Furthermore, part annotations provide structured in-
sightsintocomponent-levelperformance,facilitatingtargetedde-
sign optimizations and generative modeling for aerodynamic and
structural improvements.
3.4.2 Real-time Aerodynamic Predictions with Surro-
gate Modeling. In this work, we utilize TripNet [30], a tri-
plane neural architecture, within the Simulation Agent to rapidly
and accurately predict aerodynamic properties directly from 3D
car geometries. This enables the Simulation Agent to predict
aerodynamic properties such as drag coefficients, surface pres-
sure distributions, and full volumetric flow fields in real-time,
significantly accelerating aerodynamic analyses. The model is
trained on the DrivAerNet++ dataset and evaluated on an unseen
test set consisting of 1,200 industry-standard car designs, provid-
ing a comprehensive evaluation due to the extensive size of the
test set.
Figure12illustratesthedesigntrendsindragcoefficientanda

car designs. The ground truth values are arranged in ascending
order of drag coefficient and plotted alongside the predicted val-
ues for the same designs. The model effectively captures the
overalltrend,withpredictionscloselyfollowingthegroundtruth.
However, the predicted values exhibit some oscillatory behavior,
particularly in smaller directional variations between successive
designs. This oscillation is acceptable and does not significantly
impact the overall trend, as the model effectively captures the
general pattern of drag coefficient variation.

themodel’scapabilityinproducingrealisticaerodynamicpredic-
tions, reinforcing its applicability in engineering simulations.
Finally, the results in Table 3 demonstrate the simulation
agent’s capability to accurately predict differences in drag coef-
ficients (Δ𝐶𝐷) between various car configurations compared to
CFD simulations. For instance, the predicted drag difference
between the FD-FS and FD-N configurations is 0.066, closely
matchingtheCFDvalueof0.065. Similarly,thesimulationagent
correctly predicts the drag difference between the E-FS and E-N
configurations, with only minor deviations of 0.001. The largest
discrepancy appears in the N-FS configuration, where the pre-
dicted value is -0.00007 compared to the CFD result of -0.0003,
though this remains within an acceptable range.

cesswhilemaintainingindustry-standardengineeringconstraints.
As these AI-powered agents continue to evolve, their ability
to collaborate with human designers will redefine the future of
automotive engineering. Rather than replacing human intuition,
these agents serve as intelligent assistants, augmenting creativity
and providing real-time feedback on aerodynamic performance
and manufacturability. This approach not only streamlines the
developmentpipelinebutalsoensuresthatnoveldesignsareboth
aesthetically compelling and functionally optimized. While our
framework specifically addresses automotive design, the impli-
cations of AI-driven design agents extend broadly to any engi-
neering domain involving performance-driven simulations, such
as aerospace, naval architecture, or structural engineering. Ulti-
mately, this approach fosters a more interactive and iterative de-
sign environment, bridging creativity, aesthetics, and functional
requirements, and reshaping traditional design methodologies by
significantly enhancingefficiency andcreativity throughcollabo-
rative human-AI workflows.
6. LIMITATIONS, FUTURE WORK, AND CONCLUSION
One limitation of our approach is that mesh evaluation cur-
rentlyfocusesprimarilyongeometricandtopologicalqualitymet-
rics obtained from utilities like checkMesh . However, accurate
mesh evaluation should also incorporate validation through CFD
simulation outcomes, experimental data, and adherence to estab-
lished best practices. Additionally, aesthetics evaluation can be
inherently subjective; thus, future work should include surveys
with engineers, designers, and potential users to quantitatively
assess the visual appeal and practicality of generated designs.
Anotheravenueforfutureworkinvolvesexploringalternative
multi-agent orchestration frameworks beyond AutoGen to assess
whether different systems could further enhance agent collabora-
tion,scalability,ortaskmanagementeffectiveness. Finally,while
our approach focuses on early-stage conceptual design, styling,
andaerodynamicevaluation,futureworkcouldextendthesecapa-
bilities to prototyping, manufacturing, and market-driven design
analysis.
Finally, we conclude by presenting an AI-driven multi-
agentframeworkleveragingstate-of-the-artvision-languagemod-
