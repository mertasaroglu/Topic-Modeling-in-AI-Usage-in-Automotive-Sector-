  Abstract: A dual-function supercapacitor carbon fiber composite stores electrical energy and functions, for example, as the body shell of electric vehicles (EVs). This is achieved with a vertically aligned graphene on carbon fiber electrode, upon which metal oxides were deposited to obtain ultra-high energy density anode and cathode. A high-strength multilayer carbon composite assembly is fabricated using an alternate layer patterning configuration of epoxy and polyacrylamide gel electrolyte. The energized composite delivers a high areal energy density of 0.31 mWh cm−2 at 0.3 mm thickness and showed a high tensile strength of 518 MPa, bending strength of 477 MPa, and impact strength 2666 J/m. To show application in EVs, a toy car body fabricated with energized composite operates using the energy stored inside the frame. Moreover, when integrated with a solar cell, this composite powered an IoT (internet of things) device, showing feasibility in communication satellites.

  Abstract: For vehicle presence detection, a camera captures (1) an image of an environment of a charging station for electric vehicles. The captured image is analyzed, by a first machine learning model (2a) and by a second machine learning model (2b), wherein the first machine learning model classifies the captured image with regard to a presence of a vehicle, and wherein the second machine learning model estimates a distance between the camera and an object in the captured image. A decision logic (DL) processes (3) the output of the first machine learning model and the output of the second machine learning model and triggers a control process of the charging station (CPCS), if a vehicle has been detected by the first machine learning model and if according to the output of the second machine learning model, a distance between the camera and the detected vehicle is below a given threshold. As a result, reliable vehicle presence detection is achieved by utilizing solely an already existing 2D camera and a combination of Al-based computer vision models. Material and maintenance costs are reduced, since a 2D camera is usually already in place and no additional presence sensors such as ultrasonic sensors are required. As a consequence, drawbacks of ultrasonic sensors are avoided as they do not distinguish between different object classes, i.e. if it is a bicycle, a person or any other non-vehicle, that should not trigger the charging station's control process.

  Abstract: A fiber optic sensing cable located along a side of a paved road and runs parallel to a driving direction is monitored by distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) using Rayleigh backscattering generated along the length of the optical sensor fiber cable under dynamic vehicle loads. The interaction of vehicles with roadway locations exhibiting distressed pavement generates unique patterns of localized signals that are identified/distinguished from signals resulting from vehicles operating on roadway exhibiting a smooth pavement surface. Machine learning methods are employed to estimate an overall road surface quality as well as localizing pavement damage. Power spectral density estimation, principal component analysis, support vector machine (SVM) combined with principal component analysis (PCA), local binary pattern (LBP), and convolutional neural network (CNN) are applied to develop the machine learning models.

  Abstract: Methods, systems, and apparatuses capture event video segments from an IoT device such as a dashcam in a vehicle. When an even is detected, the original resolution video segment is converted to a low resolution video segment and stored in a cloud backend. Some embodiments thus save bandwidth and storage space by transmitting low resolution video segment to the cloud backend and further save bandwidth and storage space by only storing video in the cloud backend when an event is detected. Bandwidth is also saved because, in some embodiments, original resolution video segments are stored on the IoT device and only transmitted to a reviewer when requested. In the cloud backend, the low resolution video segment is converted to a higher resolution video using a deep learning video upscaler before it is reviewed by a reviewer. A human reviewer can also review the original resolution video segment that is stored on the IoT device if it is desired to see the video segment in its original resolution. In some embodiments, a reviewer can request that an area of interest in the video segment being reviewed is upscaled. In such embodiments the entire low resolution video segment is not always upscaled in its entirety before review.

  Abstract: In various examples, a neural network may be trained for use in vehicle re-identification tasks—e.g., matching appearances and classifications of vehicles across frames—in a camera network. The neural network may be trained to learn an embedding space such that embeddings corresponding to vehicles of the same identify are projected closer to one another within the embedding space, as compared to vehicles representing different identities. To accurately and efficiently learn the embedding space, the neural network may be trained using a contrastive loss function or a triplet loss function. In addition, to further improve accuracy and efficiency, a sampling technique—referred to herein as batch sample—may be used to identify embeddings, during training, that are most meaningful for updating parameters of the neural network.

  Abstract: Rather than randomly selecting neural networks to classify a media file, the conductor can determine which neural network engines (from the conductor ecosystem of neural networks) are the best candidates to classify a particular portion/segment of the media file (e.g., audio file, image file, video files). The best candidate neural network engine(s) can depend on the nature of the input media and the characteristics of the neural network engines. In object recognition and identification, certain neural networks can classify vehicles better than others, while another group of neural networks can classify structures better. The conductor can take out the guess work and construct in real-time an inter-classifier neural network using one or more layers selected from one or more pre-trained neural network, based on attribute(s) of the media file, to classify the media file.

  Abstract: This document describes systems and techniques related to deep association for sensor fusion. For example, a model trained using deep machine learning techniques, may be used to generate an association score matrix that includes probabilities that tracks from different types of sensors are related to the same objects. This model may be trained using a convolutional recurrent neural network and include constraints not included in other training techniques. Focal loss can be used during training to compensate for imbalanced data samples and address difficult cases, and data expansion techniques can be used to increase the multi-sensor data space. Simple thresholding techniques can be applied to the association score matrix to generate an assignment matrix that indicates whether tracks from one sensor and tracks from another sensor match. In this manner, the track association process may be more accurate than current sensor fusion techniques, and vehicle safety may be increased.

  Abstract: Today neural networks are used to enable autonomous vehicles and improve the quality of speech recognition, real-time language translation, and online search optimizations. However, operation of the neural networks for these applications consumes energy. Quantization of parameters used by the neural networks reduces the amount of memory needed to store the parameters while also reducing the power consumed during operation of the neural network. Matrix operations performed by the neural networks require many multiplication calculations, so reducing the number of bits that are multiplied reduces the energy that is consumed. Quantizing smaller sets of the parameters using a shared scale factor improves accuracy compared with quantizing larger sets of the parameters. Accuracy of the calculations may be maintained by quantizing and scaling the parameters using fine-grained per-vector scale factors. A vector includes one or more elements within a single dimension of a multi-dimensional matrix.

  Abstract: Mechanisms are provided for automatically predicting vehicle weight of a moving vehicle. Vehicle operation data is obtained from one or more on-board sensors/systems of the vehicle and features are extracted. The features are filtered based on a required working condition of the vehicle to identify intervals of features having valid feature data to thereby generate a filtered valid data. The filtered valid data is processed by a first artificial intelligence (AI) computer model based on time slices of the filtered valid data to generate a first prediction of vehicle weight, and by a second AI computer model based on buckets of key variables to generate a second prediction of vehicle weight. The first prediction is fused with the second prediction to generate a final prediction of vehicle weight which is output to downstream computing logic.

The vehicles can then quickly arrange coordinated evasions for collision avoidance. Optionally, an artificial intelligence model may process the angle and distance measurements, deriving the best-fit two-dimensional distribution.

The rule-based planner performs behavioral planning based on a scene representation of the traffic scene that replicates at least one planning scenario from a planner-specific set of predefined planning scenarios. A text-based neural network is used for selection of the at least one planning scenario. Based on the scene representation, at least one text query describing the traffic scene is generated for the neural network. The at least one query requests a behavioral recommendation that is supported by the planner-specific set of predefined planning scenarios. Based on the at least one text query, the neural network generates a text-based behavioral recommendation, which is assigned to at least one of the predefined planning scenarios.

  Abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for motion forecasting in autonomous vehicles using a machine learning model trained with cycle consistency loss. Some machine learning models are trained to predict future object motion based on past observed motion, using ground truth knowledge of future object motion. In practice, such models are often inaccurate and thus unsuitable for safety-critical operations. Disclosed herein is an improved training mechanism for an object prediction model, which training mechanism utilizes cycle consistency loss. This loss can be calculated using an inverted motion prediction-that is, given observed motion and a predicted future motion, how likely the predicted future motion, if passed through the model as if it were historical data, would result in a prediction of the observed motion. Training based on inverted or backward motion prediction can improve an ability of a machine learning model to accurately predict future motion based on observed motion.

  Abstract: In various examples, live perception from sensors of a vehicle may be leveraged to detect and classify intersection contention areas in an environment of a vehicle in real-time or near real-time. For example, a deep neural network (DNN) may be trained to compute outputs—such as signed distance functions—that may correspond to locations of boundaries delineating intersection contention areas. The signed distance functions may be decoded and/or post-processed to determine instance segmentation masks representing locations and classifications of intersection areas or regions. The locations of the intersections areas or regions may be generated in image-space and converted to world-space coordinates to aid an autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle in navigating intersections according to rules of the road, traffic priority considerations, and/or the like.

  Abstract: Systems and methods are disclosed for high torque density mechanical couplings with variable slip control. The disclosed couplings can achieve order-of-magnitude (∼10x) improvements in torque density over existing magnetic and fluid options by leveraging combined normal, frictional, and inertial forces acting on sliding mechanical elements to transmit torque. The disclosed couplings can allow for continuous modulation of high-torque loads while naturally achieving lockup at maximum engagement and remaining well-suited to forced-convection cooling in high-heat-dissipation scenarios. Additionally, the disclosed couplings can be configured to achieve "one-way clutching" behavior while retaining the ability to speed-synchronize (transmit load under partial slip) and achieve lockup. These characteristics make the disclosed couplings well suited to a variety of applications and fields, including automotive and mobile robotics applications, such as active control of vehicle differential slip, where high torque density and slip control are both of critical importance.

  Abstract: A damage prediction system that uses hazard data and/or aerial images to predict future damage and/or estimate existing damage to a structure is described herein. For example, the damage prediction system may use forecasted hazard data to predict future damage or use actual hazard data to estimate existing damage. The damage prediction system may obtain hazard data in which structures were or will be impacted by a hazard. The damage prediction system can then generate a flight plan that causes an aerial vehicle to fly over the impacted parcels and capture images. The damage prediction system can use artificial intelligence to process the images for the purpose of identifying potential damage. The damage prediction system can also use a hazard model, the hazard data, and structure characteristics to generate a damage score. The damage prediction system can then use the processed images and/or damage score to generate a virtual claim.

  Abstract: In various examples, a 3D surface structure such as the 3D surface structure of a road (3D road surface) may be observed and estimated to generate a 3D point cloud or other representation of the 3D surface structure. Since the estimated representation may be sparse, a deep neural network (DNN) may be used to predict values for a dense representation of the 3D surface structure from the sparse representation. For example, a sparse 3D point cloud may be projected to form a sparse projection image (e.g., a sparse 2D height map), which may be fed into the DNN to predict a dense projection image (e.g., a dense 2D height map). The predicted dense representation of the 3D surface structure may be provided to an autonomous vehicle drive stack to enable safe and comfortable planning and control of the autonomous vehicle.

  Abstract: An apparatus for generating electricity through rotary motion using a system of mechanically coupled gears and motors. The apparatus comprises a straight gear mechanically connected to a gear holder, which drives a small gear mounted concentrically via multiple bearings. The small gear, in turn, transmits motion to a larger gear fixed on a shared shaft, resulting in rotational movement that activates a DC motor. This motor generates direct current (DC), which is supplied to a second DC motor coupled with a gear assembly and electrical components including four N-type MOSFETs and a diode. The second motor provides rotary input to an AC alternator, which generates alternating current (AC) without requiring a direct DC input to the rotor. The gear arrangement allows sustained rotational transfer between components, enabling electricity generation with minimal external input. The system is designed for various applications such as electric vehicles, industrial automation, and robotics, offering potential benefits in reducing reliance on conventional charging methods and supporting sustainable energy solutions.

  Abstract: A cooperative autonomous vehicle (CAV) system and associated methods improve object detection performance through decentralized alignment and aggregation of sensor-derived feature-maps. The system utilizes a Translation Mod Alignment (TMA) procedure to spatially normalize sensor inputs, such as two-dimensional bird's-eye view (BEV) images or three-dimensional point clouds, into a shared coordinate frame. Feature-maps generated from these aligned inputs are then aggregated across vehicles via wireless communication interfaces to form combined feature-maps. These combined feature-maps enable enhanced cooperative object detection without the need for raw sensor data transmission, significantly reducing network bandwidth requirements. Further disclosed are specialized neural network architectures and training methods optimized for cooperative perception, ensuring minimal information loss and robust object identification across decentralized, cooperative environments.

  Abstract: A high-definition map system receives sensor data from vehicles travelling along routes and combines the data to generate a high definition map for use in driving vehicles, for example, for guiding autonomous vehicles. A pose graph is built from the collected data, each pose representing location and orientation of a vehicle. The pose graph is optimized to minimize constraints between poses. Points associated with surface are assigned a confidence measure determined using a measure of hardness/softness of the surface. A machine-learning-based result filter detects bad alignment results and prevents them from being entered in the subsequent global pose optimization. The alignment framework is parallelizable for execution using a parallel/distributed architecture. Alignment hot spots are detected for further verification and improvement. The system supports incremental updates, thereby allowing refinements of sub-graphs for incrementally improving the high-definition map for keeping it up to date.

Via image processing, the system identifies these agents within the environment. A Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation of the surroundings is then generated, encapsulating the spatiotemporal information linked to the vehicle and the recognized agents. Execution of the VLP machine learning model begins by extracting vision-based planning features from the BEV, and receiving or generating textual information characterizing various attributes of the vehicle within the environment. Text-based planning features are extracted from this textual information. To enhance model performance, a contrastive learning model is engaged to establish similarities between the vision-based and text-based planning features, and a predicted trajectory is output based on the similarities.

An on-board rail profile capture system, mounted to a railroad vehicle, captures rail profile data at regular intervals as the vehicle traverses the track. A main computer receives the rail profile data and generates track geometry data. A backend rail profile processing system receives the TGD, validates the TGD, analyzes the validated TGD to determine rail defects, validates the rail defects to determine whether they are real defects or false positives, and generates notifications and alerts based on the validated defects. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms and models for defect detection and validation.

An index of frames is used and continuously populated with data for new frames, with each frame scored on its likelihood of containing a representation of a driving scenario of interest. Each iteration of the classification model produces a classification result that is predicted to belong to the scenario of interest. Binary labels can be applied to the results. Subsequent iterative training of classification models can be performed using updated training sets containing previously labeled classification results, to improve precision and accuracy in classifying image data to a driving scenario.

  Abstract: Semantic segmentation generally refers to a machine learning process that associates a label or category with every pixel in an image. This can be used to recognize a collection of pixels that form distinct categories of objects, which may have applications in autonomous driving for example where the vehicle needs to identify other vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, pavement, and other road features from captured images of a surrounding environment. While using pixel-level annotations may be ideal for fully-supervised training of the semantic segmentation model, collecting such annotations is time-consuming and expensive, and therefore limits the scalability and practicality of fully-supervised training methods. The present disclosure enables weakly supervised training of a semantic segmentation model aided by learned prompts embedded with semantic knowledge.

  Abstract: Disclosed herein is a system for mining map data to automatically identify and/or predict turn restrictions. The systems uses street-level imagery to recognize and locate posted signs (e.g., physical signs, electronic signs) that signal, or are in some way related to, a turn restriction at an intersection. Then, the techniques use a cascade of machine learning models to accurately predict whether the recognized and located signs impose the turn restriction at the intersection. Consequently, the human effort required to identify turn restrictions is greatly decreased, if not completely eliminated. Furthermore, electronic maps can more efficiently be expanded and/or updated which improves the experience for vehicle drivers that reply upon the electronic maps for directions from original locations to destination locations.

An on-board magnetometer can be used to measure a local magnetic field intensity, and a measured magnetic field intensity can be compared to the enhanced-resolution geomagnetic map. An indicium of a position of a vehicle on the enhanced-resolution geomagnetic map can be used, along with other sensor data, to provide an enhanced position estimate (or more generally, a state variable estimate) using a particle filtering technique supported by a deep reinforcement learning approach. Such a “geomagnetic-aided navigation” approach can be robust and need not rely on other navigational aids such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) or terrestrial transmitters.

In various examples, a prediction component of an autonomous vehicle may analyze sensor data to determine, for individual agents in the environment, unique sets of additional objects that are relevant to predicting the subsequent movements of the individual agents. For a particular agent, the prediction component may determine the relative positions and/or states between the agent and the associated set of relevant objects for the agent, and may use an attention mechanism to determine an object interaction vector including weighted attention scores for each additional object relative to the agent. Object interaction vectors may be generated for any number of agents and/or any number of timesteps to determine predicted agent movements and to forecast subsequent driving scenes within the environment.

  Abstract: A symbolic execution framework for consent-verified biosensing and AGI supply chain automation is disclosed. The system governs end-to-end manufacturing, logistics, and deployment using EEG-linked biometric tokens, zero-knowledge consent modules, and treaty-bound robotics. Physical actions within factories, warehouses, and transport fleets are gated by emotional risk filters, oath-indexed execution logs, and symbolic ethics DAGs. Robotic agents and embedded AGI nodes respond only to verified biometric cognition streams or authorized treaty signatures. Edge nodes route instructions based on emotional volatility, identity lineage, and symbolic legality. All physical artifacts—components, packages, vehicles—are traceable via post-quantum consent hashes and symbolic memory. The architecture prevents coercive production, misaligned routing, or unauthorized AGI control. Applications include military-grade manufacturing locks, child-safe warehouse robotics, cognitive-authenticated deliveries, and fully auditable zero-harm logistics. This invention defines the lawful symbolic substrate for real-world AGI logistics, securing biosensed cognition-to-object flows with planetary ethics, memory provenance, and modular revocation logic.

In some embodiments, the system and/or method comprises a robotic vehicle having one or more sensors configured to collect point cloud data from locations at or near a target drop zone. At least one processor performs an object detection analysis using the point cloud data to determine if there is an object in the target drop zone. To determine if there is an object or obstruction at the target drop zone, a volume of interest that is about the size of a pay load can be generated for the target drop zone. If point cloud data indicates an object within the VOI, an obstruction exists and the payload is held rather than dropped at the target drop location.

  Abstract: Three-dimensional outdoor positioning can be considerably enhanced by using various 3D imaging techniques, LiDAR ranging measurements of surrounding landmarks, and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) reaching accuracies in the centimetres range. These technologies, in conjunction with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BeiDou, provide autonomous geo positioning. It is crucial to acknowledge the constraints of dead reckoning, which may result in mistakes in positional precision. Integrating modern imaging and correction techniques can significantly improve the accuracy and dependability of outdoor localisation. The amalgamation of various 3D imaging methodologies with LiDAR enhancements improves the comprehension and ranging of the environment, tackling the difficulties presented by GNSS constraints. The integration of IMUs with satellite systems ensures the provision of continuous traveling positioning data, even in instances of obscured or faulty satellite signals. This comprehensive approach improves outdoor location precision and expands the use of these technologies across other domains, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and geospatial analysis, resulting in more effective and dependable positioning solutions. The hardware system consists of a swarm of sensors, including GNSS, INS, IMU, LiDAR, stereo imaging, and RGB technologies, which are combined to generate three-dimensional colored representations of natural landscapes and urban environments. This system reconstructs topographical features, enabling detailed mapping and analysis. It produces comprehensive three- dimensional sensory data, including geo-location and POI identification, and incorporates advanced image processing techniques, such as edge detection, for precise spatial awareness and environmental understanding. The system is designed with a compact form factor, making it easily integrated into wearable devices and autonomous vehicles. The integration of these technologies forms a sophisticated network of swarm intelligence, crucial for autonomous vehicle positioning and navigation. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to address non-deterministic navigation, with different coupling fusion methods available. The Neuro-fuzzy PSO AI Positioning and Navigation System generates three-dimensional sensory data, providing detailed information about geographical distribution and dead reckoning areas.

  Abstract: A virtual presence system and method integrates multiple virtual presence technologies, including the ability to enable a user to experience a remote location through a plurality of different types of virtual presence devices. The different types of virtual presence devices might include virtual presence robots, as well drones, land vehicles, devices arranged to be worn by a person, and other virtual presence devices, all of which are accessible through a single website hosted on a server that provides links to the different types of virtual presence devices at selectable locations through a hierarchical query database that stores geographic coordinates, types, and features of the virtual presence devices, GIS to analyze and display geographic information, and communication methods, together with IP addresses and/or aliases that enable the devices to be accessed and controlled. The virtual presence system and method may optionally also utilize virtual reality headsets and haptic feedback devices designed to worn by users for a more immersive experience.

  Abstract: Herein, a “perception statistical performance model” (PSPM) for modelling a perception slice of a runtime stack for an autonomous vehicle or other robotic system may be used e.g. for safety/performance testing. A first PSPM is configured to: receive a computed perception ground truth; determine from the perception ground truth, based on a set of learned parameters, a probabilistic perception uncertainty distribution, the parameters learned from a set of actual perception outputs generated using the perception slice to be modelled, in order to compute a first time series of perception outputs. A second time series of perception outputs is computed using a second PSPM for modelling a second perception slice of the runtime stack, the first PSPM learned from data of a first sensor modality of the perception slice and the time series, and the second PSPM learned independently thereof from data of a second sensor modality of the second perception slice and the second time series.
